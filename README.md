# ME396 Group 2: The PesSIMists' Final Project:

## Goal:

The goal of this project is to make a custom static optimization framework using the OpenSim Python API that will allow us to estimate muscle forces from experimental muscle data and then visualize the results in an interactive app make with TKinter.

To access the custom static optimization code go to our GoogleColab at:

https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sTfZjfxMwOXnfKJiklIjZ2WANvQyiTAx?usp=sharing

### How to Use This Code
#### Static Optimization
You must first manually run the first two blocks of code to set up the environment in the correct format. This code was written in Google Colab so that you can use the OpenSim package without having to download lots of software and check dependencies in your personal environment, but this means the first time you run this code these packages will take time to install (5+ minutes). Once that is complete, then you can run the rest of the code and the custom static optimization. In this code are setup files that can be found in the Gait10dof18musc folder in the github.

The output of this code is then pushed to a google drive (pushing it straight to the github required open passwords and was a security risk).

We then put this output in this github repo that our second part of the code will read. 

#### TKinter Visualizer App
Once the GoogleColab is run take the output file folder and run the visualizer code to see the outputs.
