## ME396 Group 2: The PesSIMists' Final Project:

#Goal:

The goal of this project is to make a custom static optimization framework using the OpenSim Python API that will allow us to estimate muscle forces from experimental muscle data and then visualize the results in an interactive app make with TKinter.

To access the custom static optimization code go to our GoogleColab at:

https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sTfZjfxMwOXnfKJiklIjZ2WANvQyiTAx?usp=sharing

You must first manually run the first two blocks of code to set up the environment in the correct format, and then you can run the rest of the code and the custom static optimization.

In this code are setup files that can be found in the Gait10dof18musc folder.

Once the GoogleColab is run take the output file (also in the Gait10dof18musc) folder and run the visualizer code to see the outputs
