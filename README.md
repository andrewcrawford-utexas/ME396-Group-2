*insert link here*
You must first manually run the first two blocks of code to set up the environment in the correct format, and then you can run the rest of the code and the custom static optimization.

Once the GoogleColab is run take the output file (also in the Gait10dof18musc) folder and run the visualizer code to see the outputs
